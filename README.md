# Snowroom

A mock showroom app for consumers to peruse and purchase different colorways of a snowboard. 
All development (as well as a minimal UX/UI design and logos) was done by the creator, Johnny Povolny, 
as sample code to demonstrate expertise in the latest front-end technologies for prospective clients 
and employers. 

#### Stack

* Snowroom is written in ES6-style ReactJS and follows the Redux application architecture. 
* 3D models are displayed using a WebGL-specific build of the Unity 3D gaming engine. 
* Javascript bundle is built using Webpack, employing the Autoprefixer plugin for postcss-loader vendor prefix generation.
* Redux First Router is used for Redux-esque URL management- transforming routes into states and allowing 
the site to function in a SPA-like fashion.
* The primary development environment was Google Chrome, but the app is compatible with major browsers and common mobile devices.
